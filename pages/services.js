      <p>My mission is to enlighten others to the valuable power held within and to teach others how to use that empowerment to live a life of joy, balance, and self-love. Teaching both children how to focus on their strengths, increase their self-confidence, and attract their goals and dreams is a deep passion of mine. I teach these skills by using stories and fun activities. I also teach mindful and visual meditation techniques to help with emotional stability, improving attention, and connecting with intuition.</p>

      <p><span className="red">Coaching kids</span> is different from coaching adults because of the rapid brain development that is constantly occurring as children grow. The brain is not fully developed until the early 20s.  Adults have a developed brain and have more life experience to draw upon in their exercises with me, which makes coaching kids require a stronger teaching component.  <span className="red">Coaching kids helps build resilience, self-esteem, and self-confidence</span>. It also helps kids develop their own "heart compass" or intuition in order to think for themselves and stand up to peer pressure. Through the coaching experience, kids will learn to live life with intention, purpose, and a vision for what they want in their lives.</p>
      <p>When coaching kids, I use a combination of my own curriculum, Root To Rise, Adventures in Wisdom coaching lessons, and my personal experience as a mom and elementary school teacher. In my workshops and in one-on-one coaching sessions, I teach skills such as <span className="red">meditation, mindset, self-talk transformation, positive affirmations, and more</span>.  The skills I teach are skills that some adults have not yet learned, but that are guaranteed to help in every aspect of life, so I work to give kids a head-start in this kind of personal development that will be crucial to their fulfillment later on. Through my coaching and teaching, <span className="red">kids are empowered to be self-leaders</span> in their lives in order to create <span className="red">happiness</span> and <span className="red">success</span> with emotional resiliency as they journey through life.</p>

      <h3 className="subTitle">Adventures in Wisdom</h3>
      <p>As a certified WISDOM Coach™ through Adventures in Wisdom™, we use storytelling, discussion, activities, and parent involvement to share skills with children to equip them with amazing life skills as they grow. At Adventures in Wisdom™, our mission is to inspire and empower kids to believe in themselves and their dreams and to provide them with the tools to make that happen. Through our program kids learn how to be confident and prepared to handle the ups and downs of growing up, to think for themselves and make good decisions, and to go for it in life.</p>
      <p>Does your child struggle with being sensitive and/or emotional? And although you love your child and want them to succeed, you just don’t know how to help. I am here to help you. I am dedicated to working with children so that they can manage their emotions and see them as a gift. I base my workshops and one-on-one coaching using the Adventures in Wisdom™ program and I add in additional valuable tools related to Personality Dimensions (Colours) and Emotional Intelligence. By combining these programs together, my clients are able to rid or prevent limiting beliefs from taking over their lives and be able to set themselves up for a successful journey throughout life. </p>
      <p>Issues that manifest over time often result from beliefs we develop as children and as adults we have no understanding of how our childhood stories, patterns, or habits shape who we become. Renaye Thornborrow, CEO of Adventures in Wisdom™ says “We all want our kids to be happy and to walk in the world with their head held high…It The Adventures in Wisdom Life Coaching Program for Kids™ is a fun, story-based program that gives step-by-step tools for helping kids learn how to handle the ups and downs of growing up; to think for themselves and make good decisions; and to go for their dreams and make them happen.</p>
